My name is Ahmed Zaytoun and I am 23 years old. I have recently moved to Karlskrona to study web programming at Blekinge Tekniska HÃ¶gskolan. I came to Sweden with my family in 2015 because of the war in my country where I do not have the opportunity to fulfill my dreams, so I moved here. I would describe myself as a very determined and very motivated person and now I am investing in being able to manage in this program with a lot of experience to be able to use it in working life. I usually work out at the gym and I have it as a hobby in my spare time. My goal is to finish all the courses and gain a lot of experience and try to introduce this later after the study.
